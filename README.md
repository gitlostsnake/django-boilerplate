# boilerplate-django README

This is a barebones project that frontend wise is very basic. The backend is currently on Sqlite but I will be changing that into postgres when used in a project.

The goal for my boilerplate is to eliminate the need to re-write the basic functions required for most sites. So I can focus on building project specifics which I find are a little more fun to work on.
